Part 1 - Price Prediction

House price prediction done using ML algorithm Linear regression, Decision tree, Gradient boosting and Bagging decision tree algorithms. The optimum result achieved by using the bagging decision tree algorithm.

Part 2 - Product match

Two dataset samples were initially loaded and done some preprocessing and create a matched table. It is stored as actual_matched_product.csv and during preprocessing another table called product_matching_synthetic.csv created for creating a model.

Part 2 - Prediction model creation
By using product_matching_synthetic table some data manipulation and calculation done on the data. Then model was created by finding the optimum algorithm suited to find the match between the products in the table.
